# Improbable Beef
Synthetic beef manufactured from navel bacteria? Probable or improbable?

For this analysis, a group of researches have collected data that contains the different bacteria found in each volunteers belly button. A panel for demographic information has been completed and now it needs to visualize the bacteria data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

The goal of this analysis is to create a dynamic panel that includes demographic information and bacterial data for each volunteer. The analysis includes three charts: a bar chart that illustrates the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button, a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and a gauge chart that indictes the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button. By choosing a volunteer (UTO ID) in the dropdown menu, users can view the differences across multiple test subjects.

### After some slight customization, here's what the final prodcut looks like:
